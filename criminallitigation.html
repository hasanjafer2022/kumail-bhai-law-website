                       <h1>CRIMINAL LITIGATION</h1>
                       <p>The Indian Constitution provides the framework for criminal litigation in India. <br><br>The key provisions related to criminal litigation are primarily found in the following parts of the Constitution: <br> <br>

                        
                        
                     <span class="heading" style="margin-left: 5px;">1. Fundamental Rights: </span> Part III of the Indian Constitution contains the Fundamental Rights   that protect the basic rights and liberties of citizens.<br> Several rights are relevant to criminal litigation, including:    <br> <br> 

                      <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -330px;">  
                        a. Right to Equality:</span>Article 14 ensures equality before the law and equal protection of the law. <br> <br> 
                        
                        <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -40px;">b. Right to Life and Personal Liberty:</span> Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which includes safeguards<br> against arbitrary arrest and detention. <br> <br>
                        
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -60px;"> c. Right against Self-Incrimination:</span>Article 20(3) prohibits self-incrimination, ensuring that no person accused of an offense <br> shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. <br> <br>
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -250px;"> d. Right to Legal Representation: </span>Article 22 provides safeguards regarding arrest and detention,<br> including the right to be defended by a legal practitioner of one's choice. <br> <br>
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -80px;">2. Criminal Procedure: </span> The procedural aspects of criminal litigation are governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC).<br> The CrPC lays down the procedures for investigation, arrest, bail,<br> trial, sentencing, and appeals in criminal cases. <br> <br>
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -90px;">3. Separation of Powers: </span> The Constitution provides for the separation of powers between the legislature, executive, and judiciary. <br>This ensures an independent judiciary, which plays a crucial role in criminal<br> litigation by interpreting the law and ensuring fair trials.<br> <br>
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -230px;">4.Judicial Review:  </span> The Indian judiciary has the power of judicial review to examine the constitutionality of laws,<br> including those related to criminal offenses. If a law is found to be unconstitutional, <br>it can be struck down. <br> <br>
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -140px;">5.Right to Fair Trial: </span> Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial.This includes the right to a speedy trial, <br>the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the right to present a defense,<br> the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to be heard. <br> <br>
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -230px;">6. Punishment and Sentencing: </span> The Constitution provides guidelines for punishment and sentencing. <br>It prohibits cruel and unusual punishment under Article 21 <br>and emphasizes the principle of proportionality in sentencing. <br> <br>
                      
                        
                       
                        
              <span class="down-text"></span> It's important to note that the Constitution provides the broad framework for criminal litigation, and the detailed procedures,offenses, and penalties are covered <br>by various statutes and laws enacted by the Parliament and State legislatures, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Evidence Act, <br>and specific laws for different offenses (e.g., the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Prevention of Corruption Act, etc.).<br> These statutes work in conjunction with the Constitution to govern criminal litigation in India.</span></p>
