                       <h1>HIGH COURTS WRITS</h1>
                        <p>In the context of the Indian Constitution, High Courts possess the power to issue writs under Article 226. Writs are judicial orders issued by the court to ensure the enforcement of fundamental rights or to correct any violation or illegality. <br> <br>

                            The following are the different types of writs that can be issued by High Courts in India: <br> <br>
                            
                         <span class="heading" style="margin-left: 5px;">1. Writ of Habeas Corpus: </span> This writ is issued to safeguard an individual's personal liberty. It ensures that a person is not unlawfully detained or imprisoned and can be used to secure the release of a person who has been unlawfully detained.    <br> <br> 

                          <span class="heading">  <span class="heading2"></span>    
     2. Writ of Mandamus:</span> This writ is issued to public officials, government departments, or any other authority to perform their official duties or to refrain from doing any illegal or unauthorized acts. It is essentially a command to fulfill a public duty. <br> <br> 
                            
                            <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -85px;">3. Writ of Prohibition:</span> This writ is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent it from exceeding its jurisdiction or acting in excess of its authority. <br> <br>
                            
                           <span class="heading"style="margin-left: 20px;"> 4. Writ of Certiorari:</span> This writ is issued to review the decision of a lower court or tribunal. It is used to quash the order if it is found to be illegal, without jurisdiction, or in violation of principles of natural justice. <br> <br>
                            
                           <span class="heading"style="margin-left: 14.5px;"> 5. Writ of Quo Warranto:</span> This writ is issued to inquire into the legality of a person holding a public office and to determine whether the appointment is made in accordance with the law. It challenges the authority of a person to hold a public position. <br> <br>
                            
                   <span class="heading"style="margin-left: 20px;">6. Writ of Procedendo:</span> This writ is issued to a lower court or tribunal directing it to proceed with the case. It is used when a court or tribunal has delayed the proceedings or failed to take action. <br> <br>
                            
                            These writs play a crucial role in protecting the fundamental rights of individuals and ensuring that the government and its authorities act within the confines of the law. The High Courts have the power to issue these writs to safeguard the rights and liberties of the citizens.</p>
