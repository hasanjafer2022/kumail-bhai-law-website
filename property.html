                      <h1>PROPERTY CASES</h1>
                      <p>The Indian Constitution does not specifically contain provisions solely dedicated to property cases. However, it includes various articles and amendments that touch upon property rights and their regulation. <br> <br>

                        The key provisions related to property in the Indian Constitution are as follows : <br> <br>
                        
                     <span class="heading" style="margin-left: 5px;">1. Article 300A: </span> This article guarantees the right to property as a constitutional right. It states that no person shall be deprived of their property except by the authority of law.    <br> <br> 

                      <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -110px;">  
 2. Article 19(1)(f): </span> This provision falls under the Fundamental Rights of the Indian Constitution and guarantees the right to acquire, hold, and dispose of <br> property. However, this right is not absolute and can be subjected to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state. <br> <br> 
                        
                        <span class="heading"style="margin-left: -160px;">3. Article 31:</span> This article, which was repealed by the 44th Amendment Act in 1978, originally protected the right to property as a fundamental right. <br> It stated that no person shall be deprived of their property except for public purposes and on the payment of just compensation. <br> <br>
                        
                       <span class="heading"style="margin-left: 80px;"> 4.Various state-level laws:</span> Different Indian states have enacted their own laws related to property, such as tenancy laws, land revenue laws,  and laws governing land disputes. <br>These laws may vary from state to state. <br> <br>
                        
                       
                        
              <span class="down-text"></span> The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act, 2013 (Land Acquisition Act): This law provides the framework <br>for the acquisition of land by the government for public purposes, such as infrastructure development. It ensures fair compensation, rehabilitation, and resettlement of affected persons. <br> <br>It is important to note that the interpretation and implementation of property laws in India are influenced by judicial decisions and case law, which have evolved over time. <br>
              It is advisable to consult a legal professional or refer to the latest statutes and judicial pronouncements for precise and up-to-date information on property cases in India.</span></p>
